			<h3>Python Role Playing Game</h3>
			<p> My first ever personal project was a text based RPG game (with simple animations)
				that I created on Python and was my introduction into Object Oriented Programming.
				 You start off as a character who slowly levels up, obtains gold, armour and potions
				 who must slay many bosses. The total development time was around 70 hours and the
				 playtime is between 1 to 2 hours. It was never published. </p>

			<p>Mission: To improve the YouTube user experience from one that is essentially
					mindless scrolling to one where users can curate the content that they consume.
					<br><br>
				Features: Ability to customise users’ subscriber feed by adding, removing and
					 categorizing videos.
					 <br><br>
				Notable Obstacles: Learning how to use the Google API, fixing asynchronous
					and multiprocessing bugs, learning Flask for the first time and deploying our application with its database.
					<br><br>
				Technologies: jQuery, flexbox/CSS Grid, asyncio/concurrent.futures, Flask,
					Jinja2, Fetch API, Git, GitHub, SQLite, SQLalchemy, PostgreSQL ,YouTube API
