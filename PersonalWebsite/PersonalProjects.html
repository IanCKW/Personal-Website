			<h3>Python Role Playing Game</h3>
			<p> My first ever personal project was a text based RPG game (with simple animations) that I created on Python and was my introduction into Object Oriented Programming. You start off as a character who slowly levels up, obtains gold, armour and potions who must slay many bosses. The total development time was around 70 hours and the playtime is between 1 to 2 hours. It was never published. </p>

			<h3>Elevator Simulator</h3>
			<p> This is currently in progress and was inspired by one of my modules, CS2040. Elevator algorithms are suprisingly complex and there is no one-shoe-fits all algo that works for any situation. The animations of the elevators will push my skills as a front end developer, with special attention paid to CSS. The backend involves implementing very rigorous algorithms and data structures that take into account many corner cases. I aspire to finish this by April 2020 </p>
